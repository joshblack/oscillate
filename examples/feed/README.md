# `feed` Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Up & Running

Make sure to install all the dependencies first by running `yarn install` in
this directory. Also, make sure to run `yarn build` in the root of the project
directory (i.e., two levels above where this project is).

Once the dependencies for this example are installed, and once the initial
library build is completely, you can just run `yarn start` to get the demo up
and running.
